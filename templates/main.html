<h1>Welcome to DoorToDoor</h1>

<p>DoorToDoor is a platform to help students open doors throughout the challenging recruitment process. 
    Our platform will help students in all stages of the process, from first-years who want a better understanding 
    of different industries to seniors who need assistance with interview preparation and networking with alumni. 
    DoorToDoor will connects students with alums in various industries, allows students to share resources, interview questions,
    experiences with employers, deadlines, and provides anything else a student might need. There are many existing platforms, 
    but we want to bring it all together in one and solely focus on the Wellesley community.
